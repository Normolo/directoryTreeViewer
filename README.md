# Folder Directory Tree Generator
This project is a bat program that when executed, outputs the directory tree of the folder it is in, including all subdirectories and files present. It saves the tree to a .txt document in the same file.

## Installation
Simply copy and paste the code into a new `.bat` file and save it in the folder you wish to generate the directory tree for.

## Usage
Execute the bat program by double-clicking on the file. It will generate the directory tree and save it to a file called `dir_tree.txt` in the same folder. The program will also open the `dir_tree.txt` file in Notepad.

## Notes
The program requires admin rights to access some folders. If you encounter any access denied errors, right-click the file and select **"Run as administrator"**.
The generated `dir_tree.txt` file can be edited and saved like any other text file.
The program uses the `tree` command to generate the directory tree. This command is only available on Windows operating systems.
